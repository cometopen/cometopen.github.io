        <div class="a1">Please check out our <a href="credit.html">About us</a>.</div>
        <div class="q2">What are the rules for this tourney?</div>
        <div class="a2">Please check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1_rCV3Knip4gHp5QcDihCXZO71hfZ9LiBNSCbuseYU/edit?usp=sharing">our rules document</a>.</div>
        <div class="q3">What’s the purpose of this tourney?</div>
        <div class="a3">We’re trying to create a high production value tournament aimed at the eastern playerbase (as
            evident by our runtime). The “Eastern Tetris tourney” premise is old news at this point, but we figured that
            we
            should give it some more love. It’s not something other organizations can support too well, given that most
            of
            them are based in the west.</div>
        <div class="q4">What was it that drove VTT to the making of this Comet Open?</div>
        <div class="a4">We had the right talents and the right connections to try and make something big, something
            that
            puts us on the Tetris Tournament world map, so we did, because there was simply no reason not to— plus,
            Renge
            told us to. <img src="kamlaugh.png" width="36" height="36"></div>
        <div class="q5">How long did it take you guys to prepare for this?</div>
        <div class="a5">A very long two months.</div>
        <div class="q6">How much did it cost you guys to prepare for this?</div>
        <div class="a6">Not a dime, at the cost of our sanity. Oh yeah, speaking of not costing a dime, at the time
            of
            writing this we actually don’t have a single dime in our prize pool either. Donate? Please? 100% of the
            donations go to the winners and our funds manager is the very reputable Renge.</div>
        <div class="q7">Why “Comet Open”?</div>
        <div class="a7">The theme started out as “starry night” but somewhere along the lines it changed to Comet due
            to
            various reasons (one of which may or may not involve simping for a certain blue-headed psychopathic idol).
        </div>
        <div class="q8">Do you have easter eggs on this website?</div>
        <div class="a8">Legends tell a tale about refreshing our main page... and knocking on the comet 10 times.
